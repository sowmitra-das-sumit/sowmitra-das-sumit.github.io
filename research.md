## Research

My research interests (right now) are broadly in all aspects of Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computation. My current focus is on techniques that can bridge the gap between the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and the Fault Tolerance era of Quantum Computing. This includes **Quantum Error Correction** (QEC), **Quantum Error Mitigation** (QEM) and ways to combine aspects of both. I am also interested in **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computation**, particularly, developing techniques to make use of small scale quantum computers as helpers to classical computers, and explore what computational advantages we can gain in this regime. I am also interested in developing **High-Level Quantum Programming** primitives that can aide and accelerate the development of next-generation **Quantum Algorithms**. 

Apart from these practical interests, I also have some highly theoretical ones. Particularly... I am interested in exploring the foundations of (phenomenological) Thermodynamics, and how Information Theory interplays with the Physics of Computation. I have also dabbled in _Machine Learning_, Deep Learning and Neural Networks in the past (with publications in CVPR and IEEE Transactions). 

I am currently running an ad-hoc research group at BRACU, titled **Qu**antum **I**nformation **R**esearch **C**ollaboration, (**QuIRC**, pronounced _koo-ark_). Some areas that our current work covers - Quantum Error Correction, Learning-based Quantum Error Mitigation, Shadow Tomography, Quantum Neural Networks, Quantum Channel Discrimination, Quantum Superchannels, Entanglement Purification, and Quantum Repeaters. 

If you are interested in collaborating with me, give me an email!
